title: TimeGPT for Influenza Surveillance
description: Cutting-edge time series forecasting system using TimeGPT for epidemiological surveillance, achieving superior performance over traditional models in disease outbreak prediction
importance: 4
category: research
---

Currently developing an advanced epidemiological surveillance system using TimeGPT for accurate influenza forecasting. The system leverages state-of-the-art transformer-based time series modeling to predict influenza trends and patterns, significantly outperforming traditional epidemiological models.

### Key Achievements

- Developed TimeGPT model achieving **RMSE of 873.27** for 1-week forecasts
- **Consistently outperformed traditional epidemiological models**
- Contributing to global influenza surveillance capabilities
- Working with **University of Liverpool's Nixon Research Group**
- Advancing AI applications in public health and disease prevention

### Technical Approach

The system utilizes:

- **TimeGPT Foundation Model** - Pre-trained on diverse time series data
- **Multi-Scale Analysis** - Capturing seasonal and trend components
- **Ensemble Methods** - Combining multiple forecast horizons
- **Real-Time Processing** - Continuous data integration for surveillance

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 1-week Forecast RMSE | 873.27 |
| Model Type | TimeGPT |
| Forecast Horizon | 1-4 weeks |
| Performance | Superior to traditional models |
