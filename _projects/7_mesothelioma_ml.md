Developed a comprehensive machine learning approach for early detection of mesothelioma, a severe cancer form associated with asbestos exposure. The system utilizes multiple state-of-the-art algorithms and achieves perfect classification performance.

### Key Achievements

- Achieved perfect **100% accuracy** across all three ML algorithms
- Successfully classified **98 patients** with zero false positives/negatives
- Identified key diagnostic features including duration of symptoms and C-reactive protein
- **Published in Engineering Proceedings** conference
- Demonstrated ML potential for early cancer detection

### Technical Approach

The system employs:

- **Gradient Boosted Trees** - Ensemble learning for robust classification
- **Support Vector Machines** - Optimal hyperplane separation
- **Logistic Regression** - Probabilistic classification baseline
- **Feature Analysis** - AUC-ROC based importance ranking

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 100% |
| F1 Score | 100% |
| Patients Classified | 98 |
| False Positives | 0 |
| False Negatives | 0 |
