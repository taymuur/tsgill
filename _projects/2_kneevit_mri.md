title: KneeViT - Hybrid Architecture for Knee MRI Classification
description: Advanced hybrid deep learning model combining VGG Transformer and OverLoCK ConvNet for automated knee injury detection from MRI scans with high diagnostic accuracy
importance: 2
category: research
---

Currently developing a state-of-the-art hybrid architecture that revolutionizes knee injury diagnosis from MRI imaging. The system combines the power of Vision Transformers with specialized convolutional networks, achieving exceptional performance in detecting ACL tears, meniscus injuries, and abnormalities.

### Key Achievements

- Developed **novel hybrid VGG-Transformer architecture**
- Achieved **AUC of 0.919** for abnormal detection after 50 epochs
- Strong performance with **0.809 AUC for ACL tears** and **0.760 for meniscus tears**
- **Average AUC of 0.845** across all injury types
- Advancing automated orthopedic diagnosis through AI

### Technical Approach

The hybrid architecture leverages:

- **Vision Transformers** - Global attention mechanisms for anatomical context
- **VGG Features** - Deep spatial feature extraction
- **OverLoCK ConvNet** - Specialized localization and classification
- **Multi-Task Learning** - Simultaneous detection of multiple injury types
