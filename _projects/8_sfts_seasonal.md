title: SFTS Seasonal Pattern Analysis
description: Advanced epidemiological analysis using Complex EMD and harmonic regression to identify multi-scale disease transmission cycles in South Korean SFTS data
importance: 8
category: research
---

Currently conducting sophisticated epidemiological research on Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS) patterns in South Korea. Using advanced signal processing techniques including Complex Empirical Mode Decomposition and harmonic regression to identify seasonal transmission patterns and multi-scale disease cycles.

### Key Achievements

- Achieved **R² = 0.848** using harmonic regression for disease patterns
- Successfully applied **Complex EMD** for multi-scale analysis
- Identified significant seasonal transmission cycles
- Contributing to understanding of tick-borne disease patterns
- Advancing epidemiological modeling techniques

### Technical Approach

The analysis employs:

- **Complex EMD** - Adaptive seasonal decomposition of disease data
- **Harmonic Regression** - Periodic pattern modeling
- **Bi-coherence Analysis** - Multi-scale interaction detection
- **Statistical Validation** - Rigorous testing of epidemiological findings

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Harmonic Regression R² | 0.848 |
| Analysis Method | Complex EMD |
| Study Region | South Korea |
| Disease Focus | SFTS |
