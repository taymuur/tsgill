I am a computational researcher with **1,310+ hours of research experience** spanning AI, biomedical signal processing, and computational biology. Currently pursuing a **Masters in Data Science for Biology** at the University of East Anglia whilst serving as a **Visiting Student Researcher** at the Earlham Institute under Professor Irene Papatheodorou and Dr Gregory Wickham, and as an **Honorary Research Assistant** at the Nixon Research Group, University of Liverpool.

My research focuses on developing **computational frameworks to understand complex disease mechanisms** through multi-omics data integration, with expertise in machine learning, single-cell genomics, cell type deconvolution, and disease biomarker discovery. I have published **4 first-author papers** including work in *Epilepsy & Behavior* achieving **98.4% accuracy** in seizure classification.

**Research Interests**: Computational Biology • Single-Cell Genomics • Multi-Omics Integration • Machine Learning for Healthcare • Biomarker Discovery • Cell Type Deconvolution • Disease Modelling • Time Series Forecasting • Digital Health • Biomedical Signal Processing

**Current Projects**: Conducting dissertation research at Earlham Institute on predicting pathogenic cell types and biomarkers for Crohn's Disease progression using bulk and single-cell RNA-seq integration, deconvolution algorithms, and machine learning. Leading TimeGPT development for Influenza surveillance and seasonal pattern analysis for SFTS using Complex EMD and harmonic regression at Nixon Research Group.

**Research Impact**: 24+ citations, H-index of 3, with contributions spanning epileptic seizure detection, time series forecasting, IoT-based systems, and computational approaches for inflammatory bowel disease.

I am passionate about **translating complex biological data into actionable clinical insights** through computational methods, seeking to advance precision medicine and digital health solutions that bridge the gap between research and real-world patient impact.
