I am a research-focused electrical engineer with **1,310+ hours of research experience** in AI, computer vision, and biomedical signal processing. Currently pursuing a **Masters in Data Science for Biology** at the University of East Anglia while serving as an **Honorary Research Assistant** at the Nixon Research Group, University of Liverpool.

My research focuses on developing **novel computational architectures** for complex healthcare challenges, with expertise in machine learning, neural networks, and time series forecasting. I have published **4 first-author papers** including work in *Epilepsy & Behavior* achieving **98.4% accuracy** in seizure classification.

**Research Interests**: Artificial Intelligence • Machine Learning • Computer Vision • Biomedical Signal Processing • Deep Learning • Medical Imaging • Time Series Forecasting • Digital Health

**Current Projects**: Leading TimeGPT development for Influenza surveillance and seasonal pattern analysis for SFTS using Complex EMD and harmonic regression.

**Research Impact**: 24+ citations, H-index of 3, with contributions spanning from epileptic seizure detection to stock market forecasting and IoT-based power theft detection.

I am passionate about **bridging the gap between complex biological data and actionable clinical insights** through the power of AI, seeking to advance digital health solutions that translate research into real-world impact.
