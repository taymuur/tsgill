The intersection of data science and biology represents one of the most exciting frontiers in modern science. As I pursue my **Masters in Data Science for Biology** at the University of East Anglia, I'm exploring how computational methods can unlock insights from the vast amounts of biological data being generated daily.

## Why Data Science for Biology?

Biological research has entered the era of "big data":
- **Genomics**: Sequencing technologies generate terabytes of DNA/RNA data
- **Proteomics**: Mass spectrometry produces millions of protein measurements
- **Medical imaging**: High-resolution scans create massive datasets
