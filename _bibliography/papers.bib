  abstract={Epilepsy affects over 50 million people globally. This paper presents an automated multi-class seizure classification model using EEG signals from the Temple University Hospital Seizure Corpus. The model combines multi-head self-attention mechanism with a deep convolutional neural network to classify seven subtypes of generalized and focal epileptic seizures, achieving 0.921 weighted accuracy and 0.902 weighted F1 score.},

  abstract={Electricity theft is a worldwide issue, but it is most prevalent in developing countries like Pakistan. This system comprises a network of sensors to transmit real-time power consumption data to the microprocessor, which processes the data to detect power theft. The proposed method involves transmitting power consumption readings to ThingSpeak using IoT.},
